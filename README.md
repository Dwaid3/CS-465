Architecture

In our full-stack project, we seamlessly integrated various technologies to create a dynamic and responsive web application. The client-facing side heavily leveraged HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to provide a user-friendly interface. HTML structured the content, while JavaScript added interactivity and CSS ensured an appealing visual presentation. Node.js played a crucial role on both the client and server sides, facilitating server-side JavaScript execution.

Angular JavaScript was employed to develop the single-page application (SPA) functionality. This aspect of the project, residing on the server side, brought essential features like user authentication and admin controls. By consolidating these functions on a single page, the SPA not only enhanced user experience but also streamlined website maintenance. JavaScript continued to be pivotal in the backend, managing routing, controllers, models, and configurations.

The decision to use a NoSQL MongoDB database in the backend stemmed from the project's specific requirements. Given the limited amount of information to be stored and the emphasis on quick loading times, a NoSQL approach was preferred. MongoDB's schema flexibility was a key factor, allowing us to adhere to the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methodology seamlessly. The document-oriented nature of MongoDB made storing and updating information straightforward, aligning well with the needs of our application. This choice facilitated efficient data handling without the constraints of a rigid schema, ultimately contributing to the ease of storing and updating information in our application.

Functionality

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, serves as a lightweight data interchange format distinct from JavaScript. While JavaScript is a versatile language for both frontend and backend development, JSON acts as a language-independent method for representing data structures. In the context of full-stack development, JSON acts as a connector between the frontend and backend. When a frontend component requests data, the server responds with JSON-formatted data, easily parsed by JavaScript. This streamlined communication facilitates efficient data exchange, enhancing the overall interoperability and effectiveness of the full-stack development process.


Testing

Testing APIs in your app is a puzzle involving HTTP methods (like GET or POST) deciding what your app does with data, and endpoints acting like addresses for specific tasks. Security is the guardian, with logins, encryption (HTTPS), and secret codes (API tokens) ensuring only the right users access your app. Rate limiting prevents overuse, and headers provide extra layers of safety. Testing this mix guarantees your app not only functions smoothly but also stands resilient against potential threats, securing it thoroughly.

Reflection
This course has helped me reach my goals by teaching me another facet of software development. I believe the more exporsure I get the better idea I will have of what avenue of software development I will choose in the world. I have learned full stack basics and function, while I believe I have much more work to do to improve I do have a grasp of the basics. This will make me more marketable because I have experience in the front end and back end which just knowing how they work together can help even if you ultimately choose one or the other.
